# Task ID: 8
# Title: Design and Implement User Interface
# Status: pending

# Priority: medium
# Description: Create an intuitive UI for controlling sound source positioning in 3D space.
# Details:
Design a 3D visualization that clearly shows sound source position. Implement interactive controls for adjusting X, Y, Z coordinates. Create visual feedback for active sound sources. Ensure responsive UI that updates in real-time with parameter changes. Implement proper scaling and layout for different window sizes. Consider accessibility features for users with disabilities. Use modern C++ UI framework compatible with plugin formats. Example implementation approach:

```cpp
class BinauralPluginEditor : public juce::AudioProcessorEditor {
private:
    // 3D visualization component
    class PositionVisualizer : public juce::Component {
    private:
        float xPos = 0.0f, yPos = 0.0f, zPos = 0.0f;
        
    public:
        void paint(juce::Graphics& g) override {
            // Draw 3D visualization
            // ...
        }
        
        void mouseDown(const juce::MouseEvent& e) override {
            // Handle interaction
            // ...
        }
        
        void mouseDrag(const juce::MouseEvent& e) override {
            // Update position based on mouse movement
            // ...
            notifyPositionChanged();
        }
        
        void setPosition(float x, float y, float z) {
            xPos = x; yPos = y; zPos = z;
            repaint();
        }
        
        std::function<void(float,float,float)> onPositionChanged;
    };
    
    PositionVisualizer visualizer;
    juce::Slider xSlider, ySlider, zSlider;
    
public:
    BinauralPluginEditor() {
        // Setup UI components
        // ...
        
        // Connect UI to parameters
        // ...
    }
};
```

# Test Strategy:
Conduct usability testing with potential users to gather feedback on UI intuitiveness. Test UI responsiveness under various CPU load conditions. Verify UI updates correctly reflect parameter changes. Test UI on different screen sizes and resolutions. Ensure accessibility compliance with relevant standards.
