# Title: Comprehensive Testing and Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9, 10
# Priority: high
# Description: Conduct thorough testing and performance optimization to ensure the plugin meets all requirements.
# Details:
Implement automated test suite covering all major components. Conduct performance profiling to identify and address bottlenecks. Test on various hardware configurations, focusing on ARM processors. Optimize critical paths based on profiling results. Implement benchmarking tools to measure and compare performance improvements. Conduct listening tests to verify perceptual quality of binaural rendering. Test edge cases such as extreme parameter values and rapid parameter changes. Example testing approach:

```cpp
class PerformanceTest {
private:
    BinauralProcessor processor;
    std::vector<float> inputBuffer;
    std::vector<float> leftOutputBuffer;
    std::vector<float> rightOutputBuffer;
    
public:
    void runBenchmark(size_t bufferSize, size_t iterations) {
        // Initialize test data
        inputBuffer.resize(bufferSize, 0.0f);
        leftOutputBuffer.resize(bufferSize, 0.0f);
        rightOutputBuffer.resize(bufferSize, 0.0f);
        
        // Generate test signal (white noise)
        std::random_device rd;
        std::mt19937 gen(rd());
        std::uniform_real_distribution<float> dist(-1.0f, 1.0f);
        for (auto& sample : inputBuffer) {
            sample = dist(gen);
        }
        
        // Measure processing time
        auto startTime = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
        
        for (size_t i = 0; i < iterations; ++i) {
            // Move sound source in a circle for testing
            float angle = (float)i / iterations * 2.0f * 3.14159f;
            processor.setPosition(std::cos(angle), std::sin(angle), 0.0f);
            
            // Process audio
            processor.process(inputBuffer.data(), 
                            leftOutputBuffer.data(), 
                            rightOutputBuffer.data(), 
                            bufferSize);
        }
        
        auto endTime = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
        auto duration = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>
                        (endTime - startTime).count();
        
        // Calculate and report metrics
        float timePerBuffer = duration / (float)iterations;
        float cpuLoad = timePerBuffer / (bufferSize / 44100.0f * 1000000.0f) * 100.0f;
        
        std::cout << "Buffer size: " << bufferSize << std::endl;
        std::cout << "Average processing time: " << timePerBuffer << " us" << std::endl;
        std::cout << "Estimated CPU load: " << cpuLoad << "%" << std::endl;
    }
};
```
