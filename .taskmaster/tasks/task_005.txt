# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement HRTF Interpolation Algorithm
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop an efficient algorithm for interpolating between HRTF data points to ensure smooth transitions during sound source movement.
# Details:
Research optimal interpolation methods for HRTF data (linear, bilinear, spherical, etc.). Implement the selected interpolation algorithm with focus on computational efficiency. Create a mechanism to detect when interpolation is needed based on position changes. Optimize the algorithm for ARM processors by using SIMD instructions where available. Implement fallback methods for processors without SIMD support. Balance interpolation quality with performance requirements. Example implementation:

```cpp
class HRTFInterpolator {
private:
    // Previous position for detecting changes
    float prevX = 0.0f, prevY = 0.0f, prevZ = 0.0f;
    
    // Cached HRTF data points for current interpolation
    HRTFData* nearestPoints[8]; // For trilinear interpolation
    
public:
    // Get interpolated HRTF for current position
    void getInterpolatedHRTF(float x, float y, float z, 
                            float* leftIR, float* rightIR, 
                            size_t irLength) {
        // Check if position changed significantly
        if (positionChangedSignificantly(x, y, z)) {
            // Find nearest HRTF data points
            findNearestHRTFPoints(x, y, z);
            prevX = x; prevY = y; prevZ = z;
        }
        
        // Perform interpolation between nearest points
        interpolateHRTF(x, y, z, leftIR, rightIR, irLength);
    }
    
    // Optimized interpolation implementation
    void interpolateHRTF(float x, float y, float z,
                         float* leftIR, float* rightIR, 
                         size_t irLength) {
        // Trilinear interpolation implementation
        // ...
    }
};
```

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests that verify interpolation accuracy against reference implementations. Measure performance of interpolation algorithm under various movement scenarios. Test smoothness of transitions by analyzing output signal during rapid position changes. Benchmark on both desktop and ARM processors to ensure cross-platform performance.
