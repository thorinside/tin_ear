# Task ID: 2
# Title: Design Plugin Architecture
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a comprehensive architecture design for the binaural audio plugin, focusing on modularity and performance.
# Details:
Design a modular architecture that separates core components: HRTF processing engine, audio I/O handling, parameter management, and UI layer. Create UML diagrams for class structure and interaction flows. Define clear interfaces between modules to ensure loose coupling. Consider threading model for real-time audio processing. Document data flow for audio signal path and control parameters. Ensure the architecture supports efficient processing on ARM processors through optimized memory access patterns and minimizing cache misses.

# Test Strategy:
Conduct architecture review with team members. Create proof-of-concept implementations of critical components to validate design decisions. Simulate data flow and processing requirements to identify potential bottlenecks.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Core Modules and Responsibilities [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify and describe the main architectural modules of the real-time audio plugin, such as signal processing, parameter management, audio I/O, UI integration, and threading. Assign clear responsibilities to each module to ensure modularity and maintainability.
### Details:
List each core module, its purpose, and its interactions with other modules. Consider modularity for ARM optimization and future extensibility.

## 2. Design HRTF Processing Engine Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Specify the interface for the Head-Related Transfer Function (HRTF) processing engine, including input/output formats, parameter controls, and integration points with the core signal processing module.
### Details:
Define function signatures, data structures, and expected performance characteristics. Ensure compatibility with real-time constraints and modular architecture.

## 3. Specify Audio I/O Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Detail the mechanisms for audio input and output, including buffer management, sample formats, and synchronization with the host environment.
### Details:
Describe how audio buffers are received from and sent to the host, how in-place and buffer-to-buffer processing is handled, and how multi-channel and sample-rate variations are supported.

## 4. Develop Parameter Management Strategy [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Establish a strategy for managing plugin parameters, including real-time updates, automation, interpolation, and thread safety.
### Details:
Define how parameters are stored, updated, and communicated between the UI, host, and DSP modules. Address refresh rates and performance considerations for parameter changes.

## 5. Design UI Layer Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.4
### Description: Plan the integration of the user interface layer with the core plugin architecture, ensuring efficient communication and responsiveness.
### Details:
Specify the data flow between the UI and backend, event handling, and strategies for minimizing UI-induced latency or thread contention.

## 6. Create UML Diagrams and Data Flow Charts [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5
### Description: Produce UML diagrams and data flow charts to visually represent the architecture, module interactions, and data movement throughout the system.
### Details:
Include class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and data flow diagrams to clarify the design for developers and stakeholders.

## 7. Document Threading and Performance Considerations [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5
### Description: Detail the threading model, synchronization mechanisms, and performance optimizations, especially for ARM architectures and real-time constraints.
### Details:
Address thread safety, lock-free processing where possible, and strategies for minimizing latency and maximizing throughput on target hardware.
