# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Core Audio Processing Framework
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the foundational audio processing framework that will handle audio buffers and signal routing.
# Details:
Implement audio buffer classes with appropriate memory management for real-time processing. Create signal chain architecture that allows for flexible routing. Implement thread-safe parameter handling for real-time parameter updates. Set up appropriate audio callback structure based on target plugin formats (VST, AU, etc.). Ensure lock-free processing where possible to minimize latency. Include proper error handling and recovery mechanisms for audio processing failures. Code example for buffer processing:

```cpp
class AudioProcessor {
private:
    std::vector<float> inputBuffer;
    std::vector<float> outputBuffer;
    
    // Lock-free parameter handling
    std::atomic<float> xPosition{0.0f};
    std::atomic<float> yPosition{0.0f};
    std::atomic<float> zPosition{0.0f};
    
public:
    void process(const float* input, float* output, size_t numSamples) {
        // Copy current parameter values (thread-safe)
        float x = xPosition.load();
        float y = yPosition.load();
        float z = zPosition.load();
        
        // Process audio with current position values
        // ...
    }
    
    void setPosition(float x, float y, float z) {
        xPosition.store(x);
        yPosition.store(y);
        zPosition.store(z);
    }
};
```

# Test Strategy:
Implement unit tests for buffer operations and signal routing. Create automated tests that verify audio processing under various buffer sizes and sample rates. Measure processing time to ensure real-time performance. Test thread safety with concurrent parameter changes during audio processing.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Develop Audio Buffer Classes [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement classes to efficiently store and manage audio sample data, supporting various formats and buffer sizes required for real-time processing.
### Details:
Ensure the buffer classes support fast read/write operations, memory alignment, and are optimized for low-latency access. Consider circular buffers or lock-free data structures for real-time safety.

## 2. Implement Signal Routing [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Create a flexible routing system to connect audio sources, processors, and outputs, allowing dynamic configuration of audio signal paths.
### Details:
Design routing logic that can handle multiple input/output channels, support for inserts and sends, and efficient data transfer between processing nodes.

## 3. Add Thread-Safe Parameter Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2
### Description: Implement mechanisms to safely update and access processing parameters from multiple threads without introducing audio glitches or race conditions.
### Details:
Use atomic variables, lock-free queues, or double-buffering techniques to ensure parameter changes are applied safely during audio processing callbacks.

## 4. Set Up Audio Callback Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3
### Description: Establish the real-time audio callback mechanism that drives the processing loop, ensuring timely and consistent audio data flow.
### Details:
Integrate with the target platform's audio API (e.g., ALSA, CoreAudio, ASIO) and ensure the callback is optimized for minimal latency and jitter.

## 5. Integrate Error Handling and Recovery [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4
### Description: Add robust error detection, reporting, and recovery mechanisms to handle buffer underruns, device failures, and unexpected runtime issues.
### Details:
Implement logging, graceful fallback strategies, and automatic recovery routines to maintain audio continuity and stability.

## 6. Write Unit and Integration Tests [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5
### Description: Develop comprehensive tests to validate the correctness, performance, and thread safety of all framework components.
### Details:
Include tests for buffer operations, routing logic, parameter updates, callback timing, and error handling under simulated real-time conditions.
