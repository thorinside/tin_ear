# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Real-Time Binaural Processing Engine
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the core binaural processing engine that applies HRTF filters to input audio based on 3D position.
# Details:
Implement efficient convolution algorithm for applying HRTF filters to audio signals. Create a processing chain that handles mono input to binaural output conversion. Implement partitioned convolution for efficient processing of long HRTF impulse responses. Optimize for real-time performance by using block processing and minimizing latency. Implement thread synchronization for parameter updates during processing. Use SIMD instructions where available for parallel processing. Example implementation:

```cpp
class BinauralProcessor {
private:
    // Efficient convolution engine
    ConvolutionEngine convolver;
    
    // Position parameters
    std::atomic<float> xPos{0.0f}, yPos{0.0f}, zPos{0.0f};
    
    // HRTF management
    HRTFInterpolator interpolator;
    HRTFDataManager dataManager;
    
    // Temporary buffers for processing
    std::vector<float> leftIR, rightIR;
    
public:
    void process(const float* input, float* leftOutput, float* rightOutput, size_t numSamples) {
        // Get current position (thread-safe)
        float x = xPos.load();
        float y = yPos.load();
        float z = zPos.load();
        
        // Get interpolated HRTF for current position
        interpolator.getInterpolatedHRTF(x, y, z, leftIR.data(), rightIR.data(), irLength);
        
        // Apply HRTF convolution
        convolver.process(input, leftOutput, rightOutput, 
                         leftIR.data(), rightIR.data(), 
                         numSamples, irLength);
    }
    
    void setPosition(float x, float y, float z) {
        xPos.store(x);
        yPos.store(y);
        zPos.store(z);
    }
};
```

# Test Strategy:
Implement automated tests that verify audio output against reference implementations. Measure CPU usage and latency under various load conditions. Test with different input signals (impulse, sine sweep, white noise) to verify frequency response. Perform listening tests to verify perceptual accuracy of 3D positioning.
