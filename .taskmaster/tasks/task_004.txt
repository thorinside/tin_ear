# Task ID: 4
# Title: HRTF Data Loading and Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement efficient loading, storage, and access of HRTF data optimized for real-time processing.
# Details:
Research and select appropriate HRTF dataset format. Implement data loading from standard HRTF formats (SOFA, etc.). Create memory-efficient data structures for storing HRTF data, considering cache-friendly access patterns. Implement data compression/decompression if needed to reduce memory footprint. Design a caching mechanism for frequently accessed HRTF data points. Optimize for ARM processors by ensuring aligned memory access and minimizing data movement. Example implementation:

```cpp
class HRTFDataManager {
private:
    // Efficient data structure for HRTF storage
    struct HRTFData {
        // Aligned memory for better cache performance
        alignas(16) std::vector<float> leftEarIR;
        alignas(16) std::vector<float> rightEarIR;
        size_t sampleRate;
        size_t irLength;
    };
    
    // Cache for fast lookup
    std::unordered_map<PositionKey, HRTFData> hrtfCache;
    
public:
    bool loadHRTFDatabase(const std::string& filePath);
    HRTFData* getHRTFForPosition(float azimuth, float elevation, float distance);
};
```

# Test Strategy:
Benchmark loading times for different HRTF datasets. Measure memory usage before and after optimization. Test access times for random HRTF data points. Verify correctness of loaded data against reference implementations. Test on both desktop and ARM processors to ensure cross-platform performance.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Research HRTF Dataset Formats [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Investigate and document the various formats used for HRTF datasets, including SOFA, .mat, .3dti, and any proprietary or legacy formats. Identify key datasets (e.g., SONICOM, ARI, CIPIC, Viking) and their supported formats.
### Details:
Focus on understanding the structure, metadata, and compatibility of each format. Pay special attention to the SOFA standard and its versions, as well as any unique features or limitations of alternative formats.

## 2. Implement Data Loading from SOFA and Other Formats [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Develop robust data loaders capable of parsing and importing HRTF data from SOFA files and other identified formats. Ensure support for multiple sample rates and metadata extraction.
### Details:
Create modular code to handle format-specific parsing, error handling, and validation. Include unit tests for each supported format and sample dataset.

## 3. Design Memory-Efficient Storage Structures [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Design and implement in-memory data structures optimized for efficient storage and retrieval of large HRTF datasets, considering real-time access requirements.
### Details:
Evaluate trade-offs between array-based, sparse, and compressed representations. Document memory usage and access speed for each approach.

## 4. Develop Caching and Compression Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.3
### Description: Implement caching strategies and data compression techniques to further reduce memory footprint and improve access speed for frequently used HRTF data.
### Details:
Explore LRU caching, chunked loading, and lossless compression algorithms. Benchmark the impact on load times and memory usage.

## 5. Benchmark and Validate on Desktop and ARM Platforms [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.4
### Description: Test the complete system on both desktop (x86) and ARM-based platforms to ensure cross-platform performance, correctness, and resource efficiency.
### Details:
Measure load times, memory usage, and real-time access latency. Validate correctness of loaded data and compatibility with target hardware.
