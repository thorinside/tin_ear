# Task ID: 1
# Title: Research HRTF Processing Libraries
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Investigate and evaluate C++ libraries for HRTF processing, with a focus on VISR as specified in the PRD.
# Details:
Conduct a comprehensive evaluation of VISR and alternative HRTF processing libraries. Compare features, performance, documentation, and community support. Focus on libraries that work well on both desktop and ARM processors. Document findings including pros/cons of each option, implementation complexity, and compatibility with project requirements. Prepare a recommendation report with justification for the selected library.

# Test Strategy:
Create benchmark tests to compare performance metrics of candidate libraries on both desktop and ARM processors. Measure CPU usage, memory footprint, and processing latency under various load conditions.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Gather Requirements from PRD [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review the Product Requirements Document (PRD) to extract all technical, performance, and compatibility requirements for HRTF processing libraries.
### Details:
Identify mandatory and optional features, supported platforms (desktop, ARM), performance targets, licensing constraints, and integration needs.

## 2. Identify Candidate HRTF Processing Libraries [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Research and compile a list of candidate HRTF processing libraries, ensuring inclusion of VISR and other relevant open-source and commercial options.
### Details:
Survey academic literature, open-source repositories, and industry resources to identify libraries that meet the initial requirements.

## 3. Evaluate Features and Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Assess each candidate library for feature completeness, quality of documentation, and community or vendor support.
### Details:
Create a comparison matrix covering supported HRTF formats, interpolation methods, sample rates, API usability, and available guides or tutorials.

## 4. Benchmark Performance on Desktop and ARM [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Conduct performance benchmarks of shortlisted libraries on both desktop and ARM platforms, measuring CPU usage, memory footprint, and latency.
### Details:
Develop or adapt test harnesses to run standardized audio processing workloads, collecting quantitative performance data for each platform.

## 5. Analyze Implementation Complexity and Compatibility [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.4
### Description: Examine the integration complexity and compatibility of each library with the target application stack and platforms.
### Details:
Assess build systems, language bindings, dependency requirements, and potential obstacles for integration into existing workflows.

## 6. Compile Recommendation Report [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.5
### Description: Synthesize findings into a comprehensive report with recommendations, justifying the preferred HRTF processing library based on requirements, performance, and integration factors.
### Details:
Include comparative tables, performance charts, and a narrative summary of trade-offs and rationale for the final recommendation.
