# Task ID: 9
# Title: Optimize for ARM Processors
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Optimize the plugin for efficient performance on ARM-based processors as specified in the PRD.
# Details:
Profile the application to identify performance bottlenecks on ARM processors. Implement ARM-specific optimizations using NEON SIMD instructions where applicable. Optimize memory access patterns for ARM cache architecture. Reduce dynamic memory allocations during audio processing. Implement power-efficient algorithms to extend battery life on mobile devices. Consider using ARM-specific compiler flags and intrinsics. Example optimization approach:

```cpp
// ARM NEON optimization example for HRTF convolution
#ifdef __ARM_NEON
#include <arm_neon.h>

void optimizedConvolution(const float* input, float* output, 
                         const float* impulseResponse, 
                         size_t inputLength, size_t irLength) {
    // Use NEON SIMD instructions for parallel processing
    for (size_t i = 0; i < inputLength; ++i) {
        float32x4_t sum = vdupq_n_f32(0.0f);
        
        // Process 4 elements at once
        for (size_t j = 0; j < irLength; j += 4) {
            if (i >= j && (i - j + 3) < inputLength) {
                float32x4_t in = vld1q_f32(&input[i - j]);
                float32x4_t ir = vld1q_f32(&impulseResponse[j]);
                sum = vmlaq_f32(sum, in, ir);
            }
        }
        
        // Accumulate the 4 partial sums
        float32x2_t sum2 = vadd_f32(vget_low_f32(sum), vget_high_f32(sum));
        float32x2_t sum1 = vpadd_f32(sum2, sum2);
        output[i] = vget_lane_f32(sum1, 0);
    }
}

# Test Strategy:
Benchmark performance on various ARM processors (different generations and manufacturers). Compare optimized code against non-optimized baseline. Measure power consumption during sustained processing. Profile memory usage and cache performance. Test with different compiler optimization levels to find optimal settings.
