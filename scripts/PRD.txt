Absolutely! Here's a quick high-level outline you could use for a PRD:

**Product Requirement Document (PRD) for Binaural Audio Plugin**

**1. Objective:**

* Create a C++ plugin that allows real-time binaural audio processing using HRTF data, enabling users to position sound sources in a 3D virtual space.

**2. Key Features:**

* **Real-Time Control:** Users can adjust X, Y, Z coordinates of audio sources in real time.
* **Smooth Interpolation:** Ensure seamless transitions between data points for natural sound movement.
* **Lightweight Data Handling:** Optimize HRTF data for minimal processing load, suitable for ARM processors.
* **User Interface:** Develop an intuitive UI for positioning and controlling sound sources.

**3. Technical Requirements:**

* **Libraries:** Utilize a C++ library like VISR for HRTF processing.
* **Compatibility:** Ensure the plugin works smoothly on both desktop and ARM-based processors.
* **Performance:** Optimize code for low latency and efficient CPU usage.

**4. Timeline:**

* **Phase 1:** Research and prototyping (2-3 weeks)
* **Phase 2:** Development and integration (4-6 weeks)
* **Phase 3:** Testing and optimization (2-3 weeks)
* **Phase 4:** User feedback and final tweaks (2 weeks)

Feel free to adjust any details as you see fit!
